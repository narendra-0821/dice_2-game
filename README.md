## Description

Pig is a multiplayer dice game where the objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, accumulating a score for their turn, but losing their turn if they roll a 1.

## Rules

1. Each player rolls the die.
2. If the player rolls any number other than 1, it is added to their current score for that turn.
3. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their current score for that turn is forfeited.
4. Players can choose to "hold," which adds their current score for that turn to their total score and ends their turn.
5. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
